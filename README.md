## Project Motivation

## Simulation Environment 

In this project, we utilized a drone simulation environment based on standard quadcopter dynamics, defined by ordinary differential equations. The dynamics were derived from _Quadcopter Dynamics, Simulation, and Control_ by Andrew Gibiansky and _Quadrotor Dynamics and Control_ by Randal Beard. We employed an implementation of these dynamics from [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/abhijitmajumdar/Quadcopter_simulator), which includes a PID controller for quadcopter control and navigation.

The drone's state is represented by a 12-dimensional vector comprising:

- Position: \([x, y, z]\),
- Linear velocities,
- Angular orientations: \([\theta, \phi, \psi]\),
- Angular rates.

The action space includes thrust forces from the four motors, each ranging from 4000 to 9000 units, simulating realistic motor inputs. To facilitate reinforcement learning, the state space was extended to include a goal position and a goal yaw orientation, forming a 16-dimensional vector that encompasses both the drone's state and the goal state.

Each simulation episode begins by randomly sampling the drone's initial and goal states. The task is for the drone to navigate to the target, at which point a new goal is generated.
